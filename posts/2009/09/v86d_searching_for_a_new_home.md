<html><body><p>i've been maintaining v86d for a year, and is has to stop now.<br>

no, not because its bad to maintain it, it's just I've sold the last piece of hardware (my Thinkpad Z61m) it was useful on.<br>

my X300 has an Intel card and KMS, my iBook does not know what 86 is ;)<br>

<br>

Currently, the package has two bugs:<br>

#505977 segfault<br>

never could reproduce this one, reporter has nvidia gpu...<br>

#525415 CFLAGS setting includes random kernel headers<br>

this is easy to fix and I will do so in my orhpan upload (or provide a patch)<br>

<br>

So if someone has the hardware and need of v86d, please tell me and take over the package.<br>

<br>

PS: Christoph, do it NOW! :)</p></body></html>
