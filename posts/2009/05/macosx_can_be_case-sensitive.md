<html><body><p>Dear developers under OSX,<br>
even if your OS per default uses case-insensitive HFS+, there are people out there who prefer to use a case-sensitive file-system and do not like you to include AudioToolBox.h while the file is called AudioToolbox.h...<br>
So one patch against desmume and two against yabause and they work flawlessly on my OSX.<br>
<br>
And dear MacOSX developers,<br>
when you want to develop a great OS, don't let it throw "unsupported architecture" when the Info.plist of an app says that the executable is "Foo" while the MacOS dir only contains a "foo" one...<br>
