<html><body><p>Let <em>data</em> be <em>textarea-&gt;value</em> and <em>browser</em> be <em>(firefox or chrome)</em>.

I want the user to be able to sign the data he entered in the textarea as I do not trust the website to store the data without modification.

So far I found a couple of GnuPG/PGP based solutions:

</p><ul>

<li><a href="http://getfiregpg.org">FireGPG</a>, orphaned(not compatible with Firefox4+), <a href="https://github.com/firegpg/firegpg">there is fork on github</a></li>

<li><a href="http://gpgauth.org/">gpgAuth</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.gpgtools.org/mobile/index.html">GPGTools Mobile</a></li>

</ul>

Didn't test any of them yet, so I am asking you, <em>dear Lazyweb</em>: are these any good? Are there any more such tools? What about X.509 client certificates? Can I abuse them for signing<strong> in the browser </strong>too? So far I found login stuff only. Pointers highly appreciated.</body></html>
