This will be my first DebConf, but I have a strong feeling it won't be the last one. I hope to see some productive sessionsÂ in pkg-games and pkg-ayatana, nice people and a lot of fun in a nice country.

I will travel with ICE 729 from Duesseldorf to Munich and EN 499 from Munich to Zagreb on the 22.07.2011 and return with EN 498 and ICE 728 on 31.07.2011.

To make things louder, I will go to Wacken from 02.08.2011 until 07.08.2011, wonder to see some Debian people there :)</body></html>
