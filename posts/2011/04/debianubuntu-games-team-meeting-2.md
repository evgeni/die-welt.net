</p><ul>

<li>What: Debian/Ubuntu Games Team Meeting #2</li>

<li>When: 30.04.2011, 12:00:00 UTC</li>

<li>Where: #debian-games on irc.debian.org</li>

<li>Who: YOU!</li>

</ul>

For the agenda we have a whole bunch of leftovers from the first meeting, thus I did not plan any new items (besides of kicking Tolimar to be admin again instead of having the dream to drift away from his position ;)).

As most of us are lazy and wont klick the wiki link to read the agenda, it's served here too:

<ol>

<li>games and cross-distro collaboration</li>

<li>pending, removed, orphaned, wnpp &amp; suggested games</li>

<li>freedesktop.org/games group</li>

<li>sponsoring policy</li>

<li>cleaning old, adding new admins (and users)</li>

</ol>

Do you still remember where you will be on <strong>April 30th at 12:00 UTC</strong>? No? <strong>#debian-games on irc.debian.org</strong>. And don't you dare to be quiet! ;)</body></html>
