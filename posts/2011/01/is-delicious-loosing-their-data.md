<html><body><p>I use <a href="http://delicious.com">Delicious</a> from time to time to save bookmarks and search for stuff I can't remember where I found it. It was sad to read rumors that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/16/is-yahoo-shutting-down-del-icio-us/">Yahoo! will shut it down</a>, but that's not the point here now.



In the last months I noticed some strange behavior with their site: when surfing a page of a bookmark, you see the total number of people who have bookmarked that particular link and that number started to jump from view to view. First loaded you see a total of 183 bookmarks, 10 minutes later it's 265 bookmarks, and then 183 again. What's going on there? I guess that is some inconsistency between their datacentres or something, but I'm not sure (and I <strong>am</strong> sure that this should not happen!).



Today I noticed another funny thing: bookmarks without an owner:

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/delicious-no_user.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-769" title="delicious bookmark without a user" src="https://www.die-welt.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/delicious-no_user-300x31.png" alt="" width="300" height="31">

</a>Again, not sure what is happening here. Did the user delete his account? Delicious says all bookmarks will be gone when deleting, so this should be something different, but again, I have no clue.



I fear I will have to search a new home for my bookmarks. Any (open-source) social bookmarking service out there worth a try?</p></body></html>
