<html><body><p>As almost every year, I attended <a href="http://mrmcd.net">MRMCD</a> in Darmstadt two weeks ago. I think MRMCD is one of the nicest Chaos events we have in Germany, keep on rocking, guys!

This year, the usual hacking was enriched by a nice concert of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/tengrylab">tengrylab</a> and <a href="http://pornophonique.de/">pornophonique</a>.

If you missed the event, or want to replay it in your head, have a look at my pictures in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhenech/sets/72157631517754199/">my mrmcd2012 flickr set</a>).</p></body></html>
