<html><body><p>As almost every year, I attended <a href="http://mrmcd.net">MRMCD</a> in Darmstadt two weeks ago. I think MRMCD is one of the nicest Chaos events we have in Germany, keep on rocking, guys!



This year, the usual hacking was enriched by a nice concert of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/tengrylab">tengrylab</a> and <a href="http://pornophonique.de/">pornophonique</a>.



If you missed the event, or want to replay it in your head, have a look at my pictures of <a title="mrmcd2012" href="http://www.die-welt.net/pix/misc/mrmcd2012/">some strange hardware</a> and <a title="pornophonique-20120908" href="http://www.die-welt.net/pix/konzerte/pornophonique-20120908/">the bands playing their tunes</a>Â (both also mirrored in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zhenech/sets/72157631517754199/">my mrmcd2012 flickr set</a>).</p></body></html>
