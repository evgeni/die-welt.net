<html><body><p>Yeah. Just a great day today.<br>

Wake up at 0620, got coffee, went to school.<br>

Took a 4h long math test. Hope the answers were allright. Will see on friday(?).<br>

Then some more schoolstuff, sports education...<br>

Came home at 1745. Everything is dark. No light in the whole neighborhood. Candles everywhere. Bit romantic in it's special way.<br>

BUT: the motherboard of my workstation died in this romance with the electricity.<br>

I was lucky having mobo and cpu of a frriend here, changed the cpu and the system works again. However, it's an Elitegroup. Wanna my MSI back :<br>

Fuckin world.<br>

Good night.</p></body></html>
