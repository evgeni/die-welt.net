<br>

just because the Debian Maintainer of the NVIDIA drivers is a bit lazy and does not yet have uploaded the new beta drivers to experimental (or unstable), I've created some nice debs including the patch from zander (nvnews.net) to deactivate the smbus feature, because it sucks!<br>

<br>

Have fun with them:<br>
