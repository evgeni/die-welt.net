<html><body><p>Well, <a href="http://froscon.org">FrOSCon</a> is over and it's time to sum up the event a bit.



First of all: it was great! But it was also hot (I heard the air-condition is off during week-ends...) and busy. And still, it was great! :)



Why? Mostly because of the people of course! It was esp nice to meet <a href="http://rhonda.deb.at/">Rhonda</a> in person (almost all other people [except the <a href="http://grml.org">grml</a> ones] in the Debian-and-Friends corner were the usual suspects who you see at every (big) FOSS/Linux event). I had some nice chats with Enrico (about <a href="http://geany.org">Geany</a> and <a href="http://xfce.org">Xfce</a>) and Leo (about <a href="http://bley.mx">bley</a>), besides of the usual "when will Squeeze be released?" and "how does X work in Debian?" with random people.



When there are a lot of people, a key signing party isn't too far away. Thanks formorer for the orga! You still owe me a sig from FrOSCon 2008 ;) And if someone wonders why he/she got a sign-mail from me even when he/she wasn't at the FrOSCon KSP: I used the fact that I have to sign a lot of keys to sign even more (from the <a href="http://www.openrheinruhr.de">OpenRheinRuhr</a> 2009 KSP and the BSP in MÃ¶nchengladbach at the beginning of this year [yes tg, I even signed yours, hope you liked the MIME]).



As usual I missed almost every talk I wanted to hear and end up with just one (the one about RegEx), which sadly wasn't good at all.



I guess that's all I have to say about FrOSCon. Oh wait, no, there was a questionnaire which included the question whether I'll visit future FrOSCons. Of course!



Hope to see ya all at <a href="http://mrmcd1001b.metarheinmain.de/">MRMCD</a>, <a href="http://www.openrheinruhr.de">OpenRheinRuhr</a>, <a href="http://events.ccc.de/2010/07/30/27c3-we-come-in-peace-call-for-participation/">27C3 </a>etc...



So Long, and Thanks for All the Frogs!</p></body></html>
