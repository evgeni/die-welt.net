So what happened last week?

</p><ul>

<li>passenger (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/%EF%BB%BF599024">#﻿599024</a>): passenger-doc: Package is empty - patch sent on 06.10.2010, lucas has uploaded it on the 07.10.2010 (with my name in Changed-By *g*)﻿﻿﻿</li>

<li>cpu (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/598173">#598173</a>): cpu: FTBFS: Unable to locate package cracklib2-dev - NMU prepared and uploaded to DELAYED/10 on 06.10.2010 (10 because cpu has 2 important bugs I did not fix)</li>

<li>update-manager-gnome (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/598202">#598202</a>): update-manager-gnome: will not start - seems to be an issue with lsb_release, but I cannot reproduce it, asked submitter for more info</li>

<li>ktoon (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/599303">#599303</a>): ktoon: KToon crashes with Signal 11 - cannot reproduce either, asked submitter for more info</li>

</ul>

What does that mean? Two bugs are (almost) closed, two need more work. And this leads me to a feature I miss from <a href="http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi">http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi</a>: a comment field as <a href="http://bts.turmzimmer.net/">http://bts.turmzimmer.net/</a> has it. Will ping lucas about this later today.



Oh, and on a side-note, I joined <a href="http://ask.debian.net/">http://ask.debian.net</a> - let's help our users :)</body></html>
