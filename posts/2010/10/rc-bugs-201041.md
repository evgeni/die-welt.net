<html><body><p>Another week has passed, where is Squeeze? Sadly, I did even less than the week before, but here is the log anyways:

</p><ul>

<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/599782">#599782</a> - pyopencl: FTBFS: ImportError: No module named pyopencl

the build process imports the just built module to generate the docs but the build-path guessing in debian/rules is broken, after some testing Jakub has posted the right snippet needed. RT has to decide whether maintainer can upload a slightly updated upstream version with the fix, or the on in the archive (with the fix too ;))</li>

<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/598202">#598202</a> - update-manager-gnome: will not start

this one is from the last week - neither me nor the submitter can reproduce it any longer, thus closed</li>

<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/599523">#599523</a> - update-manager-gnome: wants to downgrade packages without any notice

submitters pinning seems broken, waiting for a reply</li>

</ul>

That's all. Sorry, I had a busy week.</body></html>
