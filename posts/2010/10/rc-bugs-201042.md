And while at it, kudos to everyone who does not post their stats to planet, actually find those bugs, etc etc. Thanks that we have such a community!

Now to the usual list of (pseudo) squashed bugs:

<ul>

<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/600782">#600782</a> - pyca is NOT compatible with the default python version 2.6

actually pyca IS compatible with python2.6, it just throws some DeprecationWarnings

after discussion with maintainer, upstream and submitter, bug downgraded to wishlist, as pyca should be ported to the new libraries to be compatible with later python versions (2.7 is still fine according to upstream, though)</li>

<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/600670">#600670</a> - libhpmud0 installs /usr/lib/libhpmud.so.0 /usr/lib/libhpmud.so.0.0.6 but sane needs /usr/lib/libhpmud.so that is in libhpmud-dev, not needed to scan

shipping the .so in libhpmud0 instead of libhpmud-dev seems wrong, patch sent to make the sane backend look for libhpmud.so AND libhpmud.so.0, submitter confirms patch works as expected. NMU not uploaded yet.</li>

<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/600530">#600530</a> - madplay needs rebuild, currently uninstallable due to dependency

madplay installs just fine in sid, as it depends libesd-alsa0|libesd0, closed as invalid by the submitter after short discussion</li>

<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/601070">#601070</a> - python-django: FTBFS in squeeze: test_correct_url_value_passes failed

some tests need network connection â†’ patch that disables these sent</li>

<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/599523">#599523</a> - update-manager-gnome: wants to downgrade packages without any notice

this one is old, got updates from the submitter, reproduced the bug in a VM. This is an <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/317186">old</a> <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/543966">known</a> bug in apt :(</li>

<li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/601186">#601186</a> - horde3: only shows php deprecations and a warning - no actual operational parts

why does php again pollute the output with useless warnings? my approach to disable the warnings wasn't succesfull, but a patch created by sed was. However I'm not confident with it (OpenSSL anyone?) and want some more eyes to look over it.</li>
