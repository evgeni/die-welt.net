<li><a href="https://flattr.com/thing/7181/newsbeuter-the-mutt-of-RSS-feedreaders">newsbeuter - the mutt of RSS feedreaders</a>

Newsbeuter is an open-source RSS/Atom feed reader for text terminals. It runs on Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and other Unix-like operating systems. Newsbeuter's great configurability and vast number of features make it a perfect choice for people that need a slick and fast feed reader that can be completely controlled via keyboard.

<em>I'm using newsbeuter as my main rss reader on the PC (but I have to admit, I read more feeds on my Android while traveling and not working at the PC).</em></li>

<li><a href="https://flattr.com/thing/21770/SparkleShare-Sharing-work-made-easy">SparkleShare - Sharing work made easy</a>

SparkleShare shines by its absence. Unlike other syncing tools it's designed to get out of your way, to make sharing documents and collaboration easier, and to make peers aware of what you are doing.

<em>Haven't used it myself yet, but it looks like a superb replacement for Dropbox in the future.</em></li>

<li><a href="https://flattr.com/thing/47518/Gajim">Gajim</a>

Gajim is a full featured and easy to use Jabber client. It is available under Linux and Window. Some features it supports: chat, groupchat, bookmarks, file transfer, link-local connection, metacontacts, secure connection, audio / video chat, ...

<em>Yes, I use screen+irssi+BitlBee much, but Gajim still deserves love as it is open the whole day too (don't ask me why).</em></li>

<li><a href="https://flattr.com/thing/71756/Mixxx-1-8-1">Mixxx 1.8.1</a>

Mixxx is free, open source software for performing live DJ mixes. Developed by a diverse community of DJs, Mixxx is a complete replacement for a conventional "turntables and mixer" DJ setup, and is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Mixxx 1.8.0 includes a year's worth of contributions from over 30 developers and artists, and is our most exciting release to date. This release includes much anticipated features such as looping, hot cues, support for multiple MIDI devices, and a brand new database-powered library. Check out the full list of changes on our blog: http://mixxxblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/mixxx-180-released.html Money collected through this Flattr account goes to directly support Mixxx development. Show some love!

<em>Awesome DJing software for the OpenDJs out there (I'm still learning).</em></li>

<li><a href="https://flattr.com/thing/73334/mentors-debian-net-Helps-you-get-your-packages-into-Debian">mentors.debian.net - Helps you get your packages into Debian</a>

Only approved members of the Debian project - so-called Debian Developers - are granted the permission to upload software packages into the Debian distribution. Still a large number of packages is maintained by non-official developers. mentors.debian.net helps them to find a sponsor to get their packages into Debian.

<em>Yeah, I am DD, but many others are not and mentors.d.n helps them to get their stuff checked and uploaded. Thanks for the time before my key got almighty ;)</em></li>

Again, all non-italics text is stolen directly from flattr, and please forgive me if I <a href="http://blog.cihar.com/archives/2010/10/25/flattr-phpmyadmin/">recommend some thing that hasn't been officialy announced yet</a> :)</body></html>
