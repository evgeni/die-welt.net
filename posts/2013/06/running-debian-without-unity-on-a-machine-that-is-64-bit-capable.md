I can show you plenty of hardware that is perfectly <em>64 bit capable</em> but probably never will run Ubuntu and/or Unity.



First, what is <em>64 bit</em> for <em>you</em>? Looking at <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download">ubuntu.com/download</a> and getting images from there, one gets the impression, that 64 bit is <em>amd64</em> (also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">x86_64</a>). If one digs deeper to <a href="http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/13.04/release/">cdimage.ubuntu.com</a>, one will find non-Intel images too: PowerPC and amrhf. As the PowerPC images are said to boot on G3 and G4 PowerPCs, these are 32 bit. Armhf is 32 bit too (arm64/aarch64 support in Linux is <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Arm64Port">just evolving</a>). So yes, if 64 bit means amd64, I do have hardware that can run Unity.



But you asked if <em>I</em> have hardware that is 64 bit capable and can run Ubuntu/Unity, so may I apply my definiton of 64 bit here? I have an old Sun Netra T1-200 (500MHz UltraSPARC IIe) running <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/sparc/">Debian's sparc port</a>, which has a 64 bit kernel and 32 bit userland. Unity? No wai.



I do not own any <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/ia64/">ia64</a> or <a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/s390/">s390/s390x</a> machines, but I am sure people do. And guess what, no Unity there either :)



Sorry for ranting like this, but 64 bit really just means that the CPU can handle 64 bit big addresses etc. End even then, it not always will do so ;)</p></body></html>
