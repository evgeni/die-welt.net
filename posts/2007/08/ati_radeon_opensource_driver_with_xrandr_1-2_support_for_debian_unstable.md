<html><body><p>As Brice Goglin writes in his blog, <a href="http://bgoglin.livejournal.com/11518.html" target="_blank">he has uploaded xserver-xorg-video-ati with XRandr 1.2 support to experimental</a>. This is version 6.7.191 of the driver and is built for Xorg 7.3 but unstable still has 7.2. Brice says, one could rebuild the driver for Xorg 7.2 just by downgrading the Build-Dep of the package to xserver-xorg-dev 1.3.0 (instead of 1.3.99).<br>
<br>
I did that, and you can get the shiny package <a href="http://debian.die-welt.net/pool/main/xorg/" target="_blank">here</a>, or directly <a href="http://debian.die-welt.net/pool/main/xorg/xserver-xorg-video-ati_6.7.191-1_i386.deb" target="_blank">here (direct link to the .deb)</a>.<br>
<br>
Hope this deb will help someone, who does not want to build it himself.<br>
