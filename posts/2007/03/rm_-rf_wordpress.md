As I had installed wordpress for a (not yet launched) project and found some security-holes in the wordpress-pages too (only lame XSS, PoC will be released later) I've just removed the whole WP-shit (wordfress as I like to say in German) and will code something by my own. If it will be hacked THEN - I can blame myself and not some dumb noobs XD</p></body></html>
