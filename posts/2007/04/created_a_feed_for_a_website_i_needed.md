<html><body><p>After reading Nico's post about <a href="http://nion.modprobe.de/blog/archives/525-Creating-RSS-feed-for-a-website-you-want.html" target="_blank">creating RSS feed for a website you want</a> I first didn't think I could use the service, but now I recognized that I <strong>need</strong> it.<br>

<br>

I own a ThinkPad Z61m from IBM/Lenovo and hate to track the new BIOS versions from the <a href="http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/MIGR-65028.html" target="_blank">website</a>.<br>

Now I have created a RSS feed for this website, which you can find here: <a href="http://feed43.com/thinkpad-z61-bios.xml">http://feed43.com/thinkpad-z61-bios.xml</a>, and added it to my Firefox^WIceweasel LiveBookmarks. So I do not have to visit the IBM website for a new BIOS.<br>

<br>

Thanks Nico!</p></body></html>
