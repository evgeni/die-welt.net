<html><body><p>Yesterday I'got my sexy Sharp Zaurus and what a geek might do? I wanted to install Linux on it.<br>

Actually, it already had Linux, but never trust things from eBay, so I decided to reinstall (or reflash...).<br>

I've chosen <a href="http://hentges.net/misc/openzaurus/index.shtml" target="_blank">Hentges' OpenZaurus ROM</a>, because it seemed to be a bit better than the stock OZ ROM.<br>

<br>

God had I fun reflashing it every 10 minutes. It seems the device istn't good if you use only 32MB RAM. Now I have flashed it with the 64-0 image and it is much smoother than before, but still hangs on ipkg upgrade. You need to upgrade it in stepps of 2 or 3 packages, than it works.<br>

AND BACKUP YOUR ipkg.conf, the update of ipkg-collateral seems to kill it :/<br>

<br>

Actually, my Zaurus won't boot, I've messed something up with the init-scripts. Will give him another try tomorrow.</p></body></html>
