<html><body><p>I've recently blogged about the unsafeness of scanalert.com. Today I've found some <a href="http://sla.ckers.org/forum/read.php?3,2662,page=1" target="_blank">interesting thread in the sla.ckers forum</a>.<br>
It seems, I'm not the one who laughs at ScanAlert and has fun with finding XSS in their sites.<br>

Cheers guys!</p></body></html>
