<html><body><p>Well, today I did one more step to my planned world-domination: I joined <a href="https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-games/" target="_blank">pkg-games</a>, the group who maintains games in Debian.<br>
I will start with pokerth (together with Mario Iseli). More will follow :)<br>
<br>
Additionally, tp-smapi should be in Debian <strong>really</strong> soon!</p></body></html>
