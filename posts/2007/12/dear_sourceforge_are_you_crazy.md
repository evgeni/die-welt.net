<html><body><p>Today I wanted to login to my sf.net account after some years of inactivity.<br>
<br>
First I got a "your password has expired" - fine, they care about good password, but mine is good enough, so lets set it back again. Nonono, if(newpass==oldpass) die(); - argh, so gave them another password. But looked once more at the text under the box: only letters and numbers please - WHAT? You force me to change my password, but don't allow me to use anything else than [A-Za-z0-9]?! Security, pft!<br>
<br>
Then I looked at my account details, and noticed my mail-address was old (but valid), so let's change this too.<br>
*click* everything gets darker and some seconds later a AJAX-popup opens, asking me for a new email-address. Wait a sec, AJAX? for changing ONE fucking e-mail? hey, I'm running at 600MHz and firefox^Wiceweasel is slow enough...<br>
<br>
If this would be *chan, I'd say "FAIL!!1" &gt;:)</p></body></html>
