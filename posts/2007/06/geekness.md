<html><body><p>Once I was sittin' on my bed in my room, my laptop on my lap (haha) and chatted over IRC with my girlfriend, who was sitting about 1 meter away in front of my table with her (crappy, windoze, compaq, bullshit) laptop. In this moment I thought: how fucking geeky is this?<br>
<br>
Well, last week(end) I saw that was nothing...<br>
<br>
As the laptop of my gf is silently dying (the screen mixes up the colors after the boot, all white is pink and it needs some time to normalize - the lcd panel seems dead), I left her my shiny Z61m for typing her "Facharbeit" (dunno how this is called in English, this is some paper you have to write at the end of your school/education/foo). The box is running Debian Sid, Xfce, OpenOffice.org and stuff, some Windoes XP is there too, but there is no office-suite installed. So I've setup her an account, showed how to login in GDM, where the filemanager (Thunar) and office-suite is, and left her alone (with my holy crypto-USB-stick - she must have felt like god, as she knews, that I do not give it to ANYBODY) and drove home (fucking 430km :().<br>
During our usual telefone calls in the evening, she told me, it's all okay, he can use my box well and I have a funny monsters game... WTF?! Monster game? Ah, wait a sec... She means Quake 3 Arena, erm, OpenArena. (Memo to the German police: Yes, we are terrorists and will kill everybody if you won't catch us ASAP!)<br>
Fine, I thought, she found some games - have fun dear.<br>
Last weekend, I was one more time down in Oberharmersbach and we really did play some rounds OpenArena together... Over fucking ad-hoc wifi (damn Intel card does not support AP-mode) on my two Thinkpads. And after that, my gf said, she <strong>likes Linux</strong>... OMFG!<br>
<br>
So let's sum up:<br>
1. my gf likes Quake<br>
2. my gf likes Linux<br>
3. my gf is actually able to USE Linux<br>
4. my gf uses IRC<br>
5. my gf is allowed to used my crypto-USB-stick<br>
<br>
This is sooo geeky, I'll have to get her some ThinkGeek/getDigital T-Shirt...<br>
<br>
PS: Yes, this is REALLY my SECOND blogpost today. I'm so damn 1337!</p></body></html>
