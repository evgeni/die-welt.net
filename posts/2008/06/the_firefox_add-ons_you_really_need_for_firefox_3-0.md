<html><body><p>Yeah, I know, Firefox 3.0 is not yet released by Mozilla (<strong><a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord" target="_blank">but it soon will be, and you can help them achieving a worldrecord</a></strong>), but I used the betas and release candidates for a long time and like to share my experience.<br>
<br>
Just some more words before I start: Firefox 3.0 is fucking great, so<br>
GET<br>
GET<br>
GET<br>
GET<br>

;-)<br>
<br>
And now to my small addon collection:<br>
<br>
1. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6227" target="_blank">oldbar</a></strong><br>
Sorry, but I find the new Awesomebar just fucking ugly and way too big for my 12" screen.<br>
oldbar makes the URL bar look like in Firefox 2.0 again (but it won't change the searching algorithm, though :/)<br>
<br>
2. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865" target="_blank">Adblock Plus</a></strong><br>
No, you can't live without a proper adblocker in todays internet and Adblock Plus is the best one.<br>
<br>
3. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615" target="_blank">Delicious Bookmarks</a></strong><br>
I do not like all those social 2.0 sites out there, but del.icio.us is great, and this addon will bring you all the nice stuff directly into your browser.<br>
<br>
4. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3780" target="_blank">Faviconize Tab</a></strong><br>
Have a way too small screen? Or just too much tabs? Use this one to make them as small as their favicon :)<br>
<br>
5. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5791" target="_blank">Flagfox</a></strong><br>
It's allways nice to know where the server is located you're connected with - now you see a small flag of that country.<br>
<br>
6. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5673" target="_blank">FxIF</a></strong><br>
Looking at many photos? Wanna know which camera was used? Look in the EXIF information with FxIF without switching away from your beloved browser.<br>
<br>
7. <strong><a href="http://pagerankstatus.mozdev.org/" target="_blank">Google Pagerank Status</a></strong><br>
You're a SEO, aren't you? ;)<br>
<br>
8. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2517" target="_blank">Googlepedia</a></strong><br>
See Wikipedia results directly in your Google search.<br>
<br>
9. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125" target="_blank">It's all text!</a></strong><br>
Annoyed by typing texts into regular webforms? Use your favorite text editor for that!<br>
<br>
10. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6105" target="_blank">keyconfig</a></strong><br>
Your keyboard is made for more then just text.<br>
<br>
11. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3829" target="_blank">Live HTTP Headers</a></strong><br>
Ah I see, you're a hacker, not a SEO. Now you can see all the stuff going between your browser and the server - live!<br>
<br>
12. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/722" target="_blank">NoScript</a></strong><br>
The internet is for porn.. eh.. malware, exploits and such. Kill them all with NoScript!<br>
<br>
13. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2570" target="_blank">Resurrect Pages</a></strong><br>
Webserver /.'ed? File not found? But the internet does not forget, search the caches NOW.<br>
<br>
14. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/966" target="_blank">Tamper Data</a></strong><br>
As I said, you're a hacker - manipulate all the forms before sending them to the server.<br>
<br>
15. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2871" target="_blank">URL Fixer</a></strong><br>
youporn.con? Yes, it works!<br>
<br>
16. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59" target="_blank">User Agent Switcher</a></strong><br>
Silly website wants a sucky IE? Or Windows, but you are running Linux? Just tell them you're brave (aren't you?).<br>
<br>
17. <strong><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60" target="_blank">Web Developer</a></strong><br>
CSS sometimes sucks, fix it now. And yeah, it can save even more time than just fixing CSS.<br>
<br>
Uhm, that's all. Don't have any more plugins installed - if you do leave me a comment :)<br>
And yeah, most of these addons are not 3.0 specific, but who cares? They still rock!</p></body></html>
