<html><body><p>ThinkPad sounds so solid and brave, not like what I am doing with it :)<br>

So I am interested how one could call it (still having some connection to "ThinkPad").<br>

<br>

On the net you can find:<br>

<strong>denkmatte</strong> (hi #debian.de - anyone reading?)<br>

<strong>denkblock</strong> (not like <a href="http://www.voelk-design.de/Bilder/cartoons/pages/Denkblock.html" target="_blank">this cartoon</a>)<br>

<strong>stinkpad</strong> (even <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Stinkpad" target="_blank">urbandictionary</a> knows it)<br>

<br>

Mine are called:<br>

<strong>shinkupaddo</strong> - that what comes out if you try to "translate" ThinkPad to Japanese<br>

<strong>chiisai</strong> - and this when you are as creative as I am and translate "small" to Japanese<br>

<br>

And how is yours called?</p></body></html>
