<html><body><p>Today I discovered, that there is a beta of <a href="http://symbianoggplay.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">OggPlay</a> for my Nokia E51 (Symbian Series 60, 3rd Generation, FeaturePack 1), which <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4857972" target="_blank">can play OGG Vorbis streams</a>.<br>
And it does really work!<br>
<br>
So here is what I did to hear my Icecast stream (which is filled with data by my MPD):<br>
1. Get the last version from <a href="http://symbianoggplay.sourceforge.net/nSIS" target="_blank">http://symbianoggplay.sourceforge.net/nSIS</a> - at the time of writing it is <a href="http://symbianoggplay.sourceforge.net/nSIS/OggPlayS60V3_1_80b2.sis" target="_blank">OggPlayS60V3_1_80b2.sis</a>.<br>
2. If you do not have an older version of OggPlay installed, you may need a skin - see the OggPlay homepage for details.<br>
3. Send the file via Bluetooth to the phone.<br>
4. Get the .m3u file for the stream.<br>
5. Send the .m3u file via Bluetooth to the phone and notice it will refuse to save it :/<br>
6. Send the .m3u file via USB to the phone.<br>
7. Open OggPlay 1.80b2<br>
8. Search for new files.<br>
9. Go to <strong>"ogg_text_string_15"</strong> (that should be streams, dunno why it fails here)<br>
10. Select your m3u and let it play.<br>
11. Notice that it plays like shit, too many gaps.<br>
12. Set <strong>Settings &gt; Playback &gt; Buffering mode</strong> to <strong>Single thread</strong> as suggested in the forums, notice that the playback did not get any better.<br>
13. Set <strong>Settings &gt; Playback &gt; Buffering mode</strong> to <strong>No buffering</strong>.<br>
14. Enjoy!<br>

Until now I listened to a couple of Marilyn Manson and Megaherz tracks without any problems. But the phone gets a little bit warm, and I bet my battery will be low in some hours.<br>
