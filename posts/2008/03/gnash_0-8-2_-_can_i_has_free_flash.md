<html><body><p>As <a href="http://www.miriamruiz.es/weblog/?p=154" target="_blank">Miry blogs, gnash 0.8.2 (the first beta) works well with youtube</a> and she has packages for Debian ready. Her post forced me to fetch the packages from <a href="http://incoming.debian.org">http://incoming.debian.org</a> and give gnash a try.<br>
<br>
Yeah, youtube really works, but this is not the only flash-based service out there, so I decided to try gnash (one more time) in my daily life/work/whatever.<br>
<br>
So here is the first shot:<br>
Google Video - does not work<br>
derbauer.de - does display something, but that cannot be called working<br>
unitymedia.de - works fine<br>
myvideo.de - does not work<br>
fonic.de - does display about 30% of the animation<br>
nokia.de - animations work, product chooser misses all images and text<br>
sonyericsson.com - makes gnash &lt;defunct&gt; (so "does not work")<br>
speedtest.net - no text, no functionality, but graphics<br>
some flash/actionscript based games of a friend of mine load, have also text problems and different ActionScript bugs<br>
<br>
It does not look good for gnash, but I leave it installed for now to see which pages I will visit tomorrow at work.</p></body></html>
