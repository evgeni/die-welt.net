Not sure what you expect to read here, but let's start with some basics.  
I'm Evgeni Golov, a <code>now()-1987</code> year old guy from Düsseldorf, Germany. I studied computer science at the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, finished my bachelor's thesis in 2009 and the master's in 2012. As academia was not my destiny, I went into consulting for various open source things for a while and am now working as a developer for <a href="https://theforeman.org">The Foreman</a>.  
In my spare time I'm working on Debian GNU/Linux (yes, Linux, I did not try kFreeBSD and Hurd yet), doing some other open-source projects and enjoy photographing.
