<html><body><h3>bley</h3>

<strong>bley</strong> is an intelligent greylisting daemon for  Postfix. It uses various test (incl. RBL and SPF) to decide whether a  sender should be grylisted or not, thus mostly eliminating the usual greylisting delay while still  filtering most of the spam.



<strong>bley</strong> was developed dyring my <a href="http://www.cn.uni-duesseldorf.de/publications/details/Golov2009a.html"> bachelor's thesis at the Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf</a> and now continues to grow as my time permits.

<h3>statusnet-widget</h3>

StatusNet Widget aims to provide an easy integration of your StatusNet (identi.ca) and Twitter timelines into your WordPress. You can provide multiple sources (= links to your profiles at identi.ca, Twitter or your own StatusNet installation), which will get fetched, merged (if you want it to do so, like when you are posting the same content to Twitter AND identi.ca) and displayed in your sidebar (with #hashtag, !group and @people links).
