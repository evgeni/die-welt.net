If you want to contact me, e-mail is the best way to do so. It's still possible to reach me via Jabber/XMPP (<strong>evgeni@golov.de</strong>), ICQ (<strong>54116744</strong>) or IRC (<strong>Zhenech</strong> on freenode, IRCNet, OFTC, etc), but mail has the biggest chance to get an answer.</p></body></html>
